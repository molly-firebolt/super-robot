# Information schema and usage views

The Firebolt information schema consists of a set of system views that contain metadata information on the objects defined in the current database. In addition, it contains a set of database usage views such as the [query history](query-history-view.md) and [running queries](running-queries.md).The Firebolt information schema relies on the standard SQL information schema with some additional information and views that are specific to Firebolt.
