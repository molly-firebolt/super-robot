# Billing

Firebolt bills are based on the consumption of resources within your account. This includes the total amount of data stored and engine usage.

* **Data storage** usage is calculated on the daily average amount of data (in bytes) stored under your Firebolt account name for indexes and raw compressed data.

* **Engine resources** usage is calculated with **one-second granularity** between the time Firebolt provisions the engine and when the engine is terminated. Warmup time for caching indexes and raw data is counted in engine usage time.

## Invoices

Invoices for Firebolt engines and data are submitted through the AWS Marketplace. The final monthly invoice is available on the third day of each month through the AWS Marketplace. A billing cycle starts on the first day of the month and finishes on the last day of the same month.

## Viewing billing information

Users with the **Account Admin** role can monitor the cost history of an account.
