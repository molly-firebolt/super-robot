# Subscribing to Firebolt and creating an account

You create a Firebolt account by subscribing to Firebolt using the AWS Marketplace. This topic guides you through that process and explains important choices you make during account setup.

## Prerequisites

* You need a valid AWS account ID and an AWS user with permission to subscribe in the AWS Marketplace. For more information, see [Controlling access to AWS Marketplace subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-iam-users-groups-policies.html).

* You need a valid email address with an organizational domain that has not already been used to create a Firebolt account with that name. By default, only one Firebolt account can be associated with the organizational domain of a registering entity. If you need multiple accounts associated with a domain, contact Firebolt support.  

  * Account names cannot be changed after they are created.

  * Emails with public domains (such as @gmail.com, @outlook.com, etc.) cannot be used for Firebolt account registration.

## To subscribe to Firebolt and create an account

{: .caution}
Firebolt uses the domain portion of the email address that you provide as your Firebolt account name. Before you begin, you may want to confirm with [Firebolt Support](mailto:support@firebolt.io) ðŸ“§ that a Firebolt account with this name does not already exist. For more information, see [Firebolt account concepts and terminology](concepts-and-terminology.md).

1. Open the [Firebolt application page in AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jstn42dmnx7xs?sr=0-1&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa).

2. Choose **Continue to Subscribe**, and then choose **Subscribe**.

3. Choose **Set Up Your Account**.  
  You are redirected to the Firebolt website to complete the sign up.

4. Enter your first name, last name, company name, business email address, and a password.  

6. Choose **Create Account**.  
  The request to create an account is sent to Firebolt for verification and approval.

7. Monitor the inbox and spam folder of the email that you used to register for a mail from Firebolt (\@firebolt.io) to confirm account creation or request more information. This usually happens within one business day.

## To log in to Firebolt for the first time

* After you receive a confirmation email from Firebolt, open the [Firebolt Manager](https://app.firebolt.io/), enter the email address and password that you used to create your account, and then choose **Log In**.
