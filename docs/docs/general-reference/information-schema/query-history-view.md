# Information schema for query history

You can use the `catalog.query_history` view to return information about queries saved to query history. The view is available in each database and contains one row for each historical query in the database. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each query as shown in the example below.


```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  catalog.query_history
LIMIT
  100;
```
